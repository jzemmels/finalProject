#STAT 585 Final Project

[![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/jzemmels/finalProject/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/jzemmels/finalProject?branch=master)

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("finalProject")
```

The function of this package is mainly in-service to the shiny app that accompanies it. To run this shiny app, run the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny::runApp(appDir = "inst/shiny")
```

Gulzina and Eryn have functions in the R folder that haven't yet been implemented into a Shiny app, so you can give them feedback based on those.

<!--Look at this cool plot:

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
library(finalProject)

plotNormal(mu=5,sigma=2,alpha = .1,obs=.5)
```

We can also generate random samples from a normal distribution and plot their averages:

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123456)
dat <- randomSample(mu=0,sigma=1,sampleSize = 25,numSamples = 100)

# Histogram of values from the last of these random samples:
randomSample_histogram(sampleData = dat,binwidth = .25,variableName = "Height",plotly = FALSE)

# Data frame of sample means from the 100 amples generated above
means <- updateSampleMeans(sampleMeans = NULL,sampleData = dat) #leaving sampleMeans argument null will generate a new vector. Can pass an existing data frame of sample means, however.

# Histogram of these sample means
sampleMeans_histogram(sampleMeans = means,binwidth = .1,variableName = "Height",plotly = FALSE)
```

## STAT 585 Final Project: statsfoRstudents package/shiny app

[![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/jzemmels/finalProject/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/jzemmels/finalProject?branch=master)

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/jzemmels/statsfoRstudents")
```

The function of this package is mainly in-service to the shiny app that accompanies it. To run this shiny app, run the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny::runApp(appDir = "statsfoRstudents/inst/shiny")
```

Gulzina and Eryn have functions in the R folder that haven't yet been implemented into a Shiny app, so you can give them feedback based on those.

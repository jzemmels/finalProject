STAT 585 Final Project
======================

[![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/jzemmels/finalProject/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/jzemmels/finalProject?branch=master)

``` r
install.packages("finalProject")
```

To run the shiny apps in this package, run the following:

``` r
runShinyApp() #to see a list of launchable apps in the inst/shiny-examples folder
runShinyApp("joe") #to launch Joe's shiny app
runShinyApp("charlotte") # laung Charlotte's very sad app
```

Gulzina and Eryn have functions in the R folder that haven't yet been implemented into a Shiny app, so you can give them feedback based on those.
